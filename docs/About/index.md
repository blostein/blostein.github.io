I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. I completed my PhD in Epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. My work broadly uses high-dimensional omics measurements as markers and mediators of environment-disease relationships.

I use tools and techniques from epidemiology, statistical genetics, and bioinformatics to understand complex human diseases.
