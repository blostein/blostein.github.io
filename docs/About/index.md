I'm a PhD candidate in Epidemiologic Science at the University of Michigan. My work broadly uses high-dimensional omics measurements as markers and mediators of enivronment-disease relationships.
My doctoral training has included work in epidemiology, statistical genetics, and bioinformatics. 

I also love science fiction, poetry & dogs [https://freidablostein.com/About/Lola].
