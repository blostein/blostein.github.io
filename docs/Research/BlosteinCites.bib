abstract = {Purpose Preterm birth (PTB) is a major cause of neonatal mortality. The vaginal microbiome is associated with PTB, but results vary across racial/ethnic populations. Some evidence suggests gestational age affects this association. We investigated these associations in a novel population, conducting a post hoc analysis assessing if associations differed between women swabbed at different gestational ages. Methods We compared vaginal microbiomes from women with PTB (n = 25) to a random sample of women with term births (n = 100) among participants in the Pregnancy Outcomes, Maternal and Infant Study, conducted in Lima, Peru. Using DADA2, we identified taxa from 16S DNA sequencing and used Dirichlet multinomial mixture models to group into community state types (CSTs). Results If gestational age at sampling was not considered, no CST (diverse, Lactobacillus-dominated or Lactobacillus iners–dominated), was associated with PTB. Among women sampled before 12 weeks' gestation, women with Lactobacillus-dominated CSTs were less likely to have a PTB than those with a diverse CST. Among those swabbed between 12 and 16 weeks' gestation, the reverse was true. Conclusions Our study supports previous literature suggesting that what constitutes a healthy vaginal microbiome varies by race/ethnicity. Longitudinal studies are necessary to disentangle effects of vaginal microbiome differences over gestation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, W. Montague Cobb-NMA Health Institute. Background: The research on binge eating has overwhelmingly focused on Whites. We aimed to study gender and ethnic differences in the association between body image dissatisfaction and binge eating in a nationally representative sample of Black adults in the USA. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), 2003–2004. Self-identified Caribbean Black (n = 1621) and African American (3570) adults aged 18 and older were enrolled. The independent variable was body dissatisfaction measured with two items. Using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI), outcome was lifetime binge eating without hierarchy according to the DSM-IV criteria. Covariates included age, socioeconomic factors (i.e., education and marital status), and body mass index. Ethnicity and gender were focal moderators. Logistic regressions were used for data analysis. Results: Despite comparable prevalence of lifetime binge eating (5 vs 4 {\%}, p {\textgreater} 0.05), African Americans reported higher body image dissatisfaction than Caribbean Blacks (36 vs 29 {\%}, p {\textgreater} 0.05). In the pooled sample, body dissatisfaction was a strong predictor of lifetime binge eating disorders. There was a significant interaction (p = 0.039) between ethnicity and body image dissatisfaction on binge eating, suggesting a stronger association between body image dissatisfaction and lifetime binge eating for Caribbean Blacks (OR = 11.65, 95 {\%} 6.89–19.72) than African Americans (OR = 6.72, 95 {\%} CI 3.97–11.37). Gender did not interact with body image dissatisfaction on binge eating. Conclusion: Ethnic variation in the link between body image dissatisfaction and binge eating may be due to within-race cultural differences in body image between African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. This may include different definitions, norms, and expectations regarding the body size. Findings suggest that ethnicity may bias relevance of body image dissatisfaction as a diagnostic criterion for binge eating disorders among diverse populations of Blacks.},

abstract = {Background Urinary catheterization, even of short duration, increases the risk of subsequent urinary tract infection (UTI). Whether the bacteria found on the surface of catheters placed for {\textless}3 days are associated with UTI risk is unknown. Methods We screened the biofilms found on the extraluminal surface of 127 catheters placed for {\textless}3 days in women undergoing elective gynecologic surgery, using targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction and an untargeted 16S rRNA taxonomic screen. Results Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Enterococcus spp were found on virtually all catheters and lactic acid bacteria in most catheters regardless of duration, but neither genus was associated with UTI development during follow-up. Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus were the most commonly identified genera in the taxonomic screen but were not associated with subsequent UTIs. Although the most common cause of UTI following catheter removal was Escherichia coli, detectable E coli on the catheter surface was not associated with subsequent UTIs. Conclusions Our analysis does not suggest that the presence of bacteria on the surface of catheters placed for {\textless}3 days leads to subsequent UTIs. Other aspects of catheter care are likely more important than preventing bacterial colonization of the catheter surface for preventing UTIs following short-term catheter placement.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), multiple episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC; vaginal yeast infection) within a 12-month period, adversely affects quality of life, mental health, and sexual activity. Diagnosis is not straightforward, as VVC is defined by the combination of often nonspecific vaginal symptoms and the presence of yeast-which is a common vaginal commensal. Estimating the incidence and prevalence is challenging: most VVC is diagnosed and treated empirically, the availability for purchase of effective therapies over the counter enables self-diagnosis and treatment, and the duration of the relatively benign VVC symptoms is short, introducing errors into any estimates relying on medical records or patient recall. METHODS: We evaluate current estimates of VVC and RVVC and provide new prevalence estimates using data from a 2011 seven-country (n = 7345) internet panel survey on VVC conducted by Ipsos Health (https://www.ipsos.com/en). We also evaluate information on VVC-associated visits using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. RESULTS: The estimated probability of VVC by age 50 varied widely by country (from 23{\%} to 49{\%}, mean 39{\%}), as did the estimated probability of RVVC after VVC (from 14{\%} to 28{\%}, mean 23{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: However estimated, the probability of RVVC was high suggesting RVVC is a common condition.},

abstract = {Prior colonization by Klebsiella pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) is associated with subsequent infection, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) populations. Screening for VRE colonization, but not K. pneumoniae, is routinely performed in some health care systems. Identification of patient factors associated with K. pneumoniae colonization could enable infection prevention.ICU patients were screened for VRE and K. pneumoniae by rectal swab culture over 2 time periods: July–October 2014 (n = 1209) and January–May 2016 (n = 1243). Patient demographics, baseline laboratory data, comorbidities, and outcomes were analyzed. 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was performed on a subset of patients (n = 248) to identify microbiota characteristics associated with VRE and K. pneumoniae colonization.K. pneumoniae colonization (17.3{\%} of patients in the 2014 cohort, 7.3{\%} in 2016) was significantly associated with VRE colonization in multivariable analysis (P = .03 in 2016; P = .08 in 2014). VRE colonization was associated with poor underlying health, whereas K. pneumoniae colonization was associated with advanced age. The most prevalent operational taxonomic units were Escherichia coli/Shigella spp., Klebsiella, and Enterococcus, consistent with high rates of detectable K. pneumoniae and VRE by culture. Microbial community structure in noncolonized patients was significantly different from those with VRE, K. pneumoniae, or both, attributable to differences in the relative abundance of Klebsiella and Enterococcus.K. pneumoniae co-colonizes with VRE and is a predominant taxon in ICU patients, but colonization was not associated with significant comorbidities. Screening for K. pneumoniae and VRE simultaneously could be an efficient approach for novel infection prevention strategies.},

abstract = {Abstract Objectives Dental caries experience, which affects 91{\%} of US adults, is a consequence of a carious process influenced by diet. Although individual foods have been implicated, we hypothesized that dietary patterns might be important predictors of caries presence. Methods We analysed data from 4467 people ≥18 years old participating in the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from 24-hour dietary recalls were classified into standard food categories and reduced to three dietary patterns using principal components (PCs) analysis. We used regression to model the log-transformed decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) score and the prevalence of any caries experience by quartiles of PC scores, controlling for potential confounders. Dietary patterns differed by age with respect to dental caries so 18-30-year-olds (n = 1074) and {\textgreater}30-year-olds (n = 3393) were analysed separately. Results Similar dietary patterns existed among individuals aged 18-30 and {\textgreater}30 years, but the prevalence of DMFT score {\textgreater}0 and the median of DMFT was greater in those {\textgreater}30:78.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 76.1, 81.3) vs 92.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 91.4, 93.7) and 4 (95{\%} CI: 4, 5) vs 12 DMFT (95{\%} CI: 11, 13), respectively. In those 18-30, no dietary pattern was associated with greater prevalence or severity of dental caries experience. Among those {\textgreater}30, the prevalence of DMFT{\textgreater}0 was higher by 2{\%} for those in each subsequent quartile of a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages and sandwiches (adjusted PR: 1.02, 95{\%} CI: 1.001, 1.03)?thus, the prevalence of dental caries experience was 6{\%} higher among those in the uppermost quartile than in the lowest quartile. For every subsequent quartile in the same pattern, there was a 1.98{\%} higher (95{\%} CI: 0.15, 3.85) DMFT score. However, analysis using the two strongest loading food groups from any of the PCs did not identify any predictors of caries experience. Conclusions Dietary patterns were associated with the prevalence of dental caries experience, with differing findings by age. Although effect sizes were small, the population impact may be substantial. While food groups high in sugar were associated with caries prevalence and severity, associations were more apparent in the context of overall diet. Prospective studies are needed to confirm whether particular dietary patterns are causally related to the development of dental caries.},

@article{Townsend2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V. Background: The U.S. is facing an unprecedented number of opioid-related overdose deaths, and an array of other countries have experienced increases in opioid-related fatalities. In the U.S., naloxone is increasingly distributed to first responders to improve early administration to overdose victims, but its cost-effectiveness has not been studied. Lay distribution, in contrast, has been found to be cost-effective, but rising naloxone prices and increased mortality due to synthetic opioids may reduce cost-effectiveness. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of increased naloxone distribution to (a) people likely to witness or experience overdose (“laypeople”); (b) police and firefighters; (c) emergency medical services (EMS) personnel; and (d) combinations of these groups. Methods: We use a decision-analytic model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of eight naloxone distribution strategies. We use a lifetime horizon and conduct both a societal analysis (accounting for productivity and criminal justice system costs) and a health sector analysis. We calculate: the ranking of strategies by net monetary benefit; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios; and number of fatal overdoses. Results: High distribution to all three groups maximized net monetary benefit and minimized fatal overdoses; it averted 21{\%} of overdose deaths compared to minimum distribution. High distribution to laypeople and one of the other groups comprised the second and third best strategies. The majority of health gains resulted from increased lay distribution. In the societal analysis, every strategy was cost-saving compared to its next-best alternative; cost savings were greatest in the maximum distribution strategy. In the health sector analysis, all undominated strategies were cost-effective. Results were highly robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Increasing naloxone distribution to laypeople and first responder groups would maximize health gains and be cost-effective. If feasible, communities should distribute naloxone to all groups; otherwise, distribution to laypeople and one of the first responder groups should be emphasized.},
