	abstract = {The impact of the oral microbiome on head and neck cancer pathogenesis and outcomes requires further study. 16s rRNA was isolated and amplified from pre-treatment oral wash samples for 52 cases and 102 controls. The sequences were binned into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the genus level. Diversity metrics and significant associations between OTUs and case status were assessed. The samples were binned into community types using Dirichlet multinomial models, and survival outcomes were assessed by community type. Twelve OTUs from the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Acinetobacter were found to differ significantly between the cases and the controls. Beta-diversity was significantly higher between the cases than between the controls (p &lt; 0.01). Two community types were identified based on the predominant sets of OTUs within our study population. The community type with a higher abundance of periodontitis-associated bacteria was more likely to be present in the cases (p &lt; 0.01), in older patients (p &lt; 0.01), and in smokers (p &lt; 0.01). Significant differences between the cases and the controls in community type, beta-diversity, and OTUs indicate that the oral microbiome may play a role in HNSCC.},

Streptococcus mutans was previously considered a primary cause, but recent research promotes the ecologic hypothesis, in which a dysbiosis in the oral microbial community leads to caries. In this incident, density sampled case-control study of 189 children followed from 2 months to 5 years, we use the salivary bacteriome to (1) prospectively test the ecological hypothesis of ECC in salivary bacteriome communities and (2) identify co-occurring salivary bacterial communities predicting future ECC.},

	n2 = {Objective:Describe associations between dental caries and dental plaque microbiome, by dentition and family membership.Methods:This cross-sectional analysis included 584 participants in the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia Cohort 1 (COHRA1). We sequenced the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (V4 region) of frozen supragingival plaque, collected 10 y prior, from 185 caries-active (enamel and dentinal) and 565 caries-free (no lesions) teeth using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequences were filtered using the R DADA2 package and assigned taxonomy using the Human Oral Microbiome Database.Results:Microbiomes of caries-active and caries-free teeth were most similar in primary dentition and least similar in permanent dentition, but caries-active teeth were significantly less diverse than caries-free teeth in all dentition types. Streptococcus mutans had greater relative abundance in caries-active than caries-free teeth in all dentition types (P < 0.01), as did Veillonella dispar in primary and mixed dentition (P < 0.01). Fusobacterium sp. HMT 203 had significantly higher relative abundance in caries-free than caries-active teeth in all dentition types (P < 0.01). In a linear mixed model adjusted for confounders, the relative abundance of S. mutans was significantly greater in plaque from caries-active than caries-free teeth (P < 0.001), and the relative abundance of Fusobacterium sp. HMT 203 was significantly lower in plaque from caries-active than caries-free teeth (P < 0.001). Adding an effect for family improved model fit for Fusobacterium sp. HMT 203 but notS. mutans.Conclusions:The diversity of supragingival plaque composition from caries-active and caries-free teeth changed with dentition, but S. mutans was positively and Fusobacterium sp. HMT 203 was negatively associated with caries regardless of dentition. There was a strong effect of family on the associations of Fusobacterium sp. HMT 203 with the caries-free state, but this was not true for S. mutans and the caries-active state.Knowledge Transfer Statement:Patients? and dentists? concerns about transmission of bacteria within families causing caries should be tempered by the evidence that some shared bacteria may contribute to good oral health.},

	abstract = {Dental caries (cavities), one of the most common infectious diseases, is caused by a number of factors. Oral microbes, dietary practices, sociodemographic factors, and dental hygiene all inform caries risk. Assessing the impact of diet is complicated as individuals eat foods in combinations, and the interactions among the foods may alter caries risk. Our study aimed to prospectively assess the association between dietary patterns and caries risk in the postpartum period, a potentially sensitive period for caries development. We analyzed in-person dental assessments and telephone food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) from 879 Caucasian women participating in the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia Cohort 2 (COHRA2) that were collected biannually for up to 6 y. One-week recall of food intake frequency was assessed using a Likert scale. We used principal component analysis to summarize the FFQ data; the top 2 components described 15% and 12% of the variance in FFQ data. The first component was characterized by high consumption of fruits and vegetables, while the second component was heavily influenced by desserts and crackers. We used a modified Poisson model to predict the risk of an increase in the number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth in the postpartum period by 1) dietary patterns and 2) individual foods and beverages at the previous study visit, after controlling for other known risk factors, including history of carious lesions. Eating a dietary pattern high in desserts and crackers was associated with a 20% increase in the number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth in the postpartum period (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.39). However, this effect was attenuated among those who also consumed a dietary pattern high in fruits and vegetables. Dietary patterns should be considered when devising interventions aimed at preventing dental caries.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Urinary catheterization, even of short duration, increases the risk of subsequent urinary tract infection (UTI). Whether the bacteria found on the surface of catheters placed for <3 days are associated with UTI risk is unknown.
METHODS: We screened the biofilms found on the extraluminal surface of 127 catheters placed for <3 days in women undergoing elective gynecologic surgery, using targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction and an untargeted 16S rRNA taxonomic screen.
RESULTS: Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Enterococcus spp were found on virtually all catheters and lactic acid bacteria in most catheters regardless of duration, but neither genus was associated with UTI development during follow-up. Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus were the most commonly identified genera in the taxonomic screen but were not associated with subsequent UTIs. Although the most common cause of UTI following catheter removal was Escherichia coli, detectable E coli on the catheter surface was not associated with subsequent UTIs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis does not suggest that the presence of bacteria on the surface of catheters placed for <3 days leads to subsequent UTIs. Other aspects of catheter care are likely more important than preventing bacterial colonization of the catheter surface for preventing UTIs following short-term catheter placement.},

@article{Townsend:2020ui,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The U.S. is facing an unprecedented number of opioid-related overdose deaths, and an array of other countries have experienced increases in opioid-related fatalities. In the U.S., naloxone is increasingly distributed to first responders to improve early administration to overdose victims, but its cost-effectiveness has not been studied. Lay distribution, in contrast, has been found to be cost-effective, but rising naloxone prices and increased mortality due to synthetic opioids may reduce cost-effectiveness. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of increased naloxone distribution to (a) people likely to witness or experience overdose ("laypeople"); (b) police and firefighters; (c) emergency medical services (EMS) personnel; and (d) combinations of these groups.
METHODS: We use a decision-analytic model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of eight naloxone distribution strategies. We use a lifetime horizon and conduct both a societal analysis (accounting for productivity and criminal justice system costs) and a health sector analysis. We calculate: the ranking of strategies by net monetary benefit; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios; and number of fatal overdoses.
RESULTS: High distribution to all three groups maximized net monetary benefit and minimized fatal overdoses; it averted 21% of overdose deaths compared to minimum distribution. High distribution to laypeople and one of the other groups comprised the second and third best strategies. The majority of health gains resulted from increased lay distribution. In the societal analysis, every strategy was cost-saving compared to its next-best alternative; cost savings were greatest in the maximum distribution strategy. In the health sector analysis, all undominated strategies were cost-effective. Results were highly robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing naloxone distribution to laypeople and first responder groups would maximize health gains and be cost-effective. If feasible, communities should distribute naloxone to all groups; otherwise, distribution to laypeople and one of the first responder groups should be emphasized.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Dental caries experience, which affects 91% of US adults, is a consequence of a carious process influenced by diet. Although individual foods have been implicated, we hypothesized that dietary patterns might be important predictors of caries presence.
METHODS: We analysed data from 4467 people ≥18 years old participating in the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from 24-hour dietary recalls were classified into standard food categories and reduced to three dietary patterns using principal components (PCs) analysis. We used regression to model the log-transformed decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) score and the prevalence of any caries experience by quartiles of PC scores, controlling for potential confounders. Dietary patterns differed by age with respect to dental caries so 18-30-year-olds (n = 1074) and >30-year-olds (n = 3393) were analysed separately.
RESULTS: Similar dietary patterns existed among individuals aged 18-30 and >30 years, but the prevalence of DMFT score >0 and the median of DMFT was greater in those >30:78.7% (95% CI: 76.1, 81.3) vs 92.6% (95% CI: 91.4, 93.7) and 4 (95% CI: 4, 5) vs 12 DMFT (95% CI: 11, 13), respectively. In those 18-30, no dietary pattern was associated with greater prevalence or severity of dental caries experience. Among those >30, the prevalence of DMFT>0 was higher by 2% for those in each subsequent quartile of a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages and sandwiches (adjusted PR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.001, 1.03)-thus, the prevalence of dental caries experience was 6% higher among those in the uppermost quartile than in the lowest quartile. For every subsequent quartile in the same pattern, there was a 1.98% higher (95% CI: 0.15, 3.85) DMFT score. However, analysis using the two strongest loading food groups from any of the PCs did not identify any predictors of caries experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns were associated with the prevalence of dental caries experience, with differing findings by age. Although effect sizes were small, the population impact may be substantial. While food groups high in sugar were associated with caries prevalence and severity, associations were more apparent in the context of overall diet. Prospective studies are needed to confirm whether particular dietary patterns are causally related to the development of dental caries.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The research on binge eating has overwhelmingly focused on Whites. We aimed to study gender and ethnic differences in the association between body image dissatisfaction and binge eating in a nationally representative sample of Black adults in the USA.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), 2003-2004. Self-identified Caribbean Black (n = 1621) and African American (3570) adults aged 18 and older were enrolled. The independent variable was body dissatisfaction measured with two items. Using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI), outcome was lifetime binge eating without hierarchy according to the DSM-IV criteria. Covariates included age, socioeconomic factors (i.e., education and marital status), and body mass index. Ethnicity and gender were focal moderators. Logistic regressions were used for data analysis.
RESULTS: Despite comparable prevalence of lifetime binge eating (5 vs 4 %, p > 0.05), African Americans reported higher body image dissatisfaction than Caribbean Blacks (36 vs 29 %, p > 0.05). In the pooled sample, body dissatisfaction was a strong predictor of lifetime binge eating disorders. There was a significant interaction (p = 0.039) between ethnicity and body image dissatisfaction on binge eating, suggesting a stronger association between body image dissatisfaction and lifetime binge eating for Caribbean Blacks (OR = 11.65, 95 % 6.89-19.72) than African Americans (OR = 6.72, 95 % CI 3.97-11.37). Gender did not interact with body image dissatisfaction on binge eating.
CONCLUSION: Ethnic variation in the link between body image dissatisfaction and binge eating may be due to within-race cultural differences in body image between African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. This may include different definitions, norms, and expectations regarding the body size. Findings suggest that ethnicity may bias relevance of body image dissatisfaction as a diagnostic criterion for binge eating disorders among diverse populations of Blacks.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), multiple episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC; vaginal yeast infection) within a 12-month period, adversely affects quality of life, mental health, and sexual activity. Diagnosis is not straightforward, as VVC is defined by the combination of often nonspecific vaginal symptoms and the presence of yeast-which is a common vaginal commensal. Estimating the incidence and prevalence is challenging: most VVC is diagnosed and treated empirically, the availability for purchase of effective therapies over the counter enables self-diagnosis and treatment, and the duration of the relatively benign VVC symptoms is short, introducing errors into any estimates relying on medical records or patient recall.
METHODS: We evaluate current estimates of VVC and RVVC and provide new prevalence estimates using data from a 2011 seven-country (n = 7345) internet panel survey on VVC conducted by Ipsos Health (https://www.ipsos.com/en). We also evaluate information on VVC-associated visits using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.
RESULTS: The estimated probability of VVC by age 50 varied widely by country (from 23% to 49%, mean 39%), as did the estimated probability of RVVC after VVC (from 14% to 28%, mean 23%).

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major cause of neonatal mortality. The vaginal microbiome is associated with PTB, but results vary across racial/ethnic populations. Some evidence suggests gestational age affects this association. We investigated these associations in a novel population, conducting a post hoc analysis assessing if associations differed between women swabbed at different gestational ages.
METHODS: We compared vaginal microbiomes from women with PTB (n = 25) to a random sample of women with term births (n = 100) among participants in the Pregnancy Outcomes, Maternal and Infant Study, conducted in Lima, Peru. Using DADA2, we identified taxa from 16S DNA sequencing and used Dirichlet multinomial mixture models to group into community state types (CSTs).
RESULTS: If gestational age at sampling was not considered, no CST (diverse, Lactobacillus-dominated or Lactobacillus iners-dominated), was associated with PTB. Among women sampled before 12 weeks' gestation, women with Lactobacillus-dominated CSTs were less likely to have a PTB than those with a diverse CST. Among those swabbed between 12 and 16 weeks' gestation, the reverse was true.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports previous literature suggesting that what constitutes a healthy vaginal microbiome varies by race/ethnicity. Longitudinal studies are necessary to disentangle effects of vaginal microbiome differences over gestation.},

@article{Blostein:2021vh,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The bacteriome is associated with susceptibility to some eukaryotic viruses, but no study has examined associations between the salivary bacteriome and human herpesviruses (HHVs). We provide new prevalence and incidence estimates for salivary herpesviruses detection and estimate associations with bacteriome diversity in young children.
METHODS: Salivary samples collected at ages ~2, 8, 12, and 24 months from 153 children participating in the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia cohort 2 (COHRA2) were screened for HHVs using the Fast-Track Neuro9 multiplex PCR assay, and for the bacteriome using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We used Cox proportional hazard models to test for associations between the salivary bacteriome and hazards of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV6).
RESULTS: CMV, HHV6, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were detected at all visits. Human herpesvirus-7 (HHV7) was first detected at the 8-month visit and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) was only detected at the 12-month visit. Varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus 2, and human herpesvirus-8 were never detected. HHV6 (24-month cumulative incidence: 73.8%) and CMV (24-month cumulative incidence: 32.3%) were detected most frequently. Increasing salivary bacteriome diversity was associated with longer survival to first detection of CMV (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.24 [0.12, 0.49]) and HHV6 (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.24 [0.13, 0.44]).
CONCLUSION: CMV, HHV6, EBV, HHV7, and HSV1 were detected in the saliva during the first 2 years of life. Time to first detection of CMV and HHV6 was associated with salivary bacteriome diversity, suggesting a possible interaction between HHVs and the salivary bacteriome.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review: We describe different methods for microbiome assessment and analysis and highlight some of the challenges of using omics data in epidemiologic studies of adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Recent findings: Human microbiomes are dynamic and vary by ancestry and geography. The composition and dynamics of the vaginal microbiome has been associated with risk of preterm birth.
Summary: There are several different methods for characterizing the microbiome. Choice of method depends on the research question and resources available. Added to known challenges of conducting and analyzing epidemiologic studies are the unique challenges associated with microbiome detection and analysis. The resulting omics assessments of human microbial communities have great potential to identify prognostics, diagnostics and potentially therapeutics for adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

	abstract = {Prior colonization by Klebsiella pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) is associated with subsequent infection, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) populations. Screening for VRE colonization, but not K. pneumoniae, is routinely performed in some health care systems. Identification of patient factors associated with K. pneumoniae colonization could enable infection prevention.ICU patients were screened for VRE and K. pneumoniae by rectal swab culture over 2 time periods: July--October 2014 (n = 1209) and January--May 2016 (n = 1243). Patient demographics, baseline laboratory data, comorbidities, and outcomes were analyzed. 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was performed on a subset of patients (n = 248) to identify microbiota characteristics associated with VRE and K. pneumoniae colonization.K. pneumoniae colonization (17.3{\%} of patients in the 2014 cohort, 7.3{\%} in 2016) was significantly associated with VRE colonization in multivariable analysis (P = .03 in 2016; P = .08 in 2014). VRE colonization was associated with poor underlying health, whereas K. pneumoniae colonization was associated with advanced age. The most prevalent operational taxonomic units were Escherichia coli/Shigella spp., Klebsiella, and Enterococcus, consistent with high rates of detectable K. pneumoniae and VRE by culture. Microbial community structure in noncolonized patients was significantly different from those with VRE, K. pneumoniae, or both, attributable to differences in the relative abundance of Klebsiella and Enterococcus.K. pneumoniae co-colonizes with VRE and is a predominant taxon in ICU patients, but colonization was not associated with significant comorbidities. Screening for K. pneumoniae and VRE simultaneously could be an efficient approach for novel infection prevention strategies.},
