	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia (NPS) collectively refer to behavioral and psychological symptoms affecting individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease or related dementia (ADRD). NPS are among the most troubling aspects of living with dementia but their treatments have limited efficacy. We aim to investigate genetic variants contributing to NPS to identify new therapeutic targets. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for nine NPS domains measured by the Neuropsychiatric Symptom Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) in 12,800 participants from Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers across the United States. We performed a replication analysis in two independent cohorts. RESULTS: We found genome-wide significant signals for agitation, anxiety, apathy, delusions, and hallucinations that were driven by the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. We replicated these findings in ADNI and BioVU cohorts. Mediation analyses revealed that, except for apathy, MCI/ADRD severity only partially mediated the GWAS signals. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest the APOE ε4 allele influences several NPS independently of and beyond its effect on ADRD. HIGHLIGHTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Effective NPS treatments are pressingly needed, and genetic studies can inform treatment targets to develop effective therapeutics. We conducted a genome-wide association study of NPS in over 12,800 individuals and a replication analysis in two independent cohorts. We found apolipoprotein E (APOE) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with multiple NPS domains beyond their effects on cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {BackgroundDNA methylation clocks have emerged as promising biomarkers for cognitive impairment and dementia. Longitudinal studies exploring the association between DNA methylation clocks and cognitive decline have been constrained by limited sample sizes and a lack of diversity.ObjectiveOur study aimed to investigate associations between DNA methylation clocks and incident cognitive impairment using a larger and US nationally-representative sample from the Health and Retirement Study.MethodsWe measured DNA methylation age acceleration in 2016 by regressing the DNA methylation clocks, including GrimAge, against chronological age. Cognitive change over time was determined by Langa-Weir cognition status from 2016 to 2018. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the association between DNA methylation age acceleration and cognitive change, adjusting for cell-type proportions, demographic, and health factors. We also applied inverse probability weighting to address potential selection bias from varying loss-to-follow-up rates.ResultsThe analytic sample (N = 2713) was 54% female, 8.4% Black/African American, 86% White, 7.5% Hispanic, and 68 years old at baseline. During the two years of follow-up, 12% experienced cognitive change and had higher baseline GrimAge (mean = 1.2 years) acceleration compared to those maintaining normal cognition (mean = -0.8 years). A one-year increase in GrimAge acceleration was associated with 1.05 times higher adjusted and survey-weighted odds of cognitive change during follow-up (95% CI: 1.01-1.10). This association was consistent after accounting for loss-to-follow-up (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.04-1.11).ConclusionsOur study offers insights into DNA methylation age acceleration associated with cognitive change over time, suggesting avenues for improved prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder accelerates DNA methylation age, a biological aging marker. Subclinical depressive symptoms are common, but their link to DNA methylation aging in older adults remains unexplored. This study analyzed the cross-sectional relationship between depressive symptoms and accelerated DNA methylation aging, considering gender and race/ethnicity in U.S. adults aged over 50. We used data from 3,882 diverse participants in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study wave, measuring blood DNA methylation age against chronologic age for acceleration. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. Multiple linear regression evaluated the association between depressive symptoms and DNA methylation age acceleration, adjusting for sociodemographic factors, blood cell proportions, and health behaviors (physical activity, alcohol use, smoking, and chronic conditions). Gender and race/ethnicity modifications were also tested. Depressive symptoms, measured by continuous CES-D score, high depressive symptoms (CES-D ≥ 4), or any symptoms (CES-D ≥ 1), significantly correlated with increased GrimAge DNA methylation age acceleration (all p ≤ .001) in unadjusted and sociodemographic-adjusted models but were nonsignificant in fully adjusted models. No significant gender or race/ethnicity effect modifications were found in fully adjusted models. Health behaviors significantly influence DNA methylation age acceleration and depressive phenotypes, underscoring the need to understand their roles in assessing psychological factors related to DNA methylation age acceleration.

	abstract = {While it is known that vitamin D deficiency is associated with adverse bone outcomes, it remains unclear whether low vitamin D status may increase the risk of a wider range of health outcomes. We had the opportunity to explore the association between common genetic variants associated with both 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and the vitamin D binding protein (DBP, encoded by the GC gene) with a comprehensive range of health disorders and laboratory tests in a large academic medical center. We used summary statistics for 25OHD and DBP to generate polygenic scores (PGS) for 66,482 participants with primarily European ancestry and 13,285 participants with primarily African ancestry from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Biobank (BioVU). We examined the predictive properties of PGS(25OHD), and two scores related to DBP concentration with respect to 1322 health-related phenotypes and 315 laboratory-measured phenotypes from electronic health records. In those with European ancestry: (a) the PGS(25OHD) and PGS(DBP) scores, and individual SNPs rs4588 and rs7041 were associated with both 25OHD concentration and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations; (b) higher PGS(25OHD) was associated with decreased concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol, and reduced risks of vitamin D deficiency, disorders of lipid metabolism, and diabetes. In general, the findings for the African ancestry group were consistent with findings from the European ancestry analyses. Our study confirms the utility of PGS and two key variants within the GC gene (rs4588 and rs7041) to predict the risk of vitamin D deficiency in clinical settings and highlights the shared biology between vitamin D-related genetic pathways a range of health outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is associated with increased risk of caries, but the extent this increase extends into the postpartum period is poorly understood. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Describe the epidemiology of dental decay in the postpartum period among Black/African American and White American women and explore associations with potentially modifiable risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 1,131 Black/African American and White women participating in Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia cohorts. Women were enrolled during the first two trimesters of pregnancy. Calibrated dental professionals completed dental examinations at the prenatal enrollment visit, and 2-month, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year postpartum visits. RESULTS: Between the prenatal visit and 2-month visit, the incidence of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) increase was 6.92/100 person-months, compared to 3.6/100 person-months between the 2-month and 1-year visit. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression predicting incidence of caries up to 3-years postpartum, being younger, having less than college education, a household income <$50,000, smoking cigarettes, a DMFT >0, a very poor or poor Oral hygiene Rating Index, lower salivary pH at enrollment, or frequently drinking 100% juice increased the hazard of new dental caries. Adjusting for race/ethnic group did not affect the direction or magnitude of observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: The strong associations of prior DMFT and Oral Rating Index with occurrence of new dental caries postpartum suggests that targeting young women for interventions to improve oral health may be more valuable for reducing caries incidence during pregnancy and in the postpartum period than targeting women only during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {The oral microbiota plays an important role in the exogenous nitrate reduction pathway and is associated with heart and periodontal disease and cigarette smoking. We describe smoking-related changes in oral microbiota composition and resulting potential metabolic pathway changes that may explain smoking-related changes in disease risk. We analyzed health information and salivary microbiota composition among 1601 Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol participants collected 2017--2018. Salivary microbiota taxa were assigned from amplicon sequences of the 16S-V4 rRNA and used to describe microbiota composition and predict metabolic pathways. Aerobic taxa relative abundance decreased with daily smoking intensity and increased with years since cessation, as did inferred nitrate reduction. Former smokers tended to be more similar to Never smokers than to Current smokers, especially those who had quit for longer than 5 years. Cigarette smoking has a consistent, generalizable association on oral microbiota composition and predicted metabolic pathways, some of which associate in a dose-dependent fashion. Smokers who quit for longer than 5 years tend to have salivary microbiota profiles comparable to never smokers.},

	abstract = { By age 5, approximately one-fifth of children have early childhood caries (ECC). Both the oral microbiome and host genetics are thought to influence susceptibility. Whether the oral microbiome modifies genetic susceptibility to ECC has not been tested. We test whether the salivary bacteriome modifies the association of a polygenic score (PGS, a score derived from genomic data that summarizes genetic susceptibility to disease) for primary tooth decay on ECC in the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia 2 longitudinal birth cohort. Children were genotyped using the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array and underwent annual dental examinations. We constructed a PGS for primary tooth decay using weights from an independent, genome-wide association meta-analysis. Using Poisson regression, we tested for associations between the PGS (high versus low) and ECC incidence, adjusting for demographic characteristics (n = 783). An incidence-density sampled subset of the cohort (n = 138) had salivary bacteriome data at 24 mo of age. We tested for effect modification of the PGS on ECC case status by salivary bacterial community state type (CST). By 60 mo, 20.69\% of children had ECC. High PGS was not associated with an increased rate of ECC (incidence rate ratio, 1.09; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.83--1.42). However, having a cariogenic salivary bacterial CST at 24 mo was associated with ECC (odds ratio [OR], 7.48; 95\% CI, 3.06--18.26), which was robust to PGS adjustment. An interaction existed between the salivary bacterial CST and the PGS on the multiplicative scale (P = 0.04). The PGS was associated with ECC (OR, 4.83; 95\% CI, 1.29--18.17) only among individuals with a noncariogenic salivary bacterial CST (n = 70). Genetic causes of caries may be harder to detect when not accounting for cariogenic oral microbiomes. As certain salivary bacterial CSTs increased ECC risk across genetic risk strata, preventing colonization of cariogenic microbiomes would be universally beneficial. },

The sequences were binned into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the genus level. Diversity metrics and significant associations between OTUs and case status were assessed. The samples were binned into community types using Dirichlet multinomial models, and survival outcomes were assessed by community type. Twelve OTUs from the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Acinetobacter were found to differ significantly between the cases and the controls. Beta-diversity was significantly higher between the cases than between the controls (p &lt; 0.01). Two community types were identified based on the predominant sets of OTUs within our study population. The community type with a higher abundance of periodontitis-associated bacteria was more likely to be present in the cases (p &lt; 0.01), in older patients (p &lt; 0.01), and in smokers (p &lt; 0.01). Significant differences between the cases and the controls in community type, beta-diversity, and OTUs indicate that the oral microbiome may play a role in HNSCC.},

We sequenced the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (V4 region) of frozen supragingival plaque, collected 10 y prior, from 185 caries-active (enamel and dentinal) and 565 caries-free (no lesions) teeth using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequences were filtered using the R DADA2 package and assigned taxonomy using the Human Oral Microbiome Database.Results:Microbiomes of caries-active and caries-free teeth were most similar in primary dentition and least similar in permanent dentition, but caries-active teeth were significantly less diverse than caries-free teeth in all dentition types. Streptococcus mutans had greater relative abundance in caries-active than caries-free teeth in all dentition types (P < 0.01), as did Veillonella dispar in primary and mixed dentition (P < 0.01). Fusobacterium sp. HMT 203 had significantly higher relative abundance in caries-free than caries-active teeth in all dentition types (P < 0.01). In a linear mixed model adjusted for confounders, the relative abundance of S. mutans was significantly greater in plaque from caries-active than caries-free teeth (P < 0.001), and the relative abundance of Fusobacterium sp. HMT 203 was significantly lower in plaque from caries-active than caries-free teeth (P < 0.001). Adding an effect for family improved model fit for Fusobacterium sp. HMT 203 but notS. mutans.Conclusions:The diversity of supragingival plaque composition from caries-active and caries-free teeth changed with dentition, but S. mutans was positively and Fusobacterium sp. HMT 203 was negatively associated with caries regardless of dentition. There was a strong effect of family on the associations of Fusobacterium sp. HMT 203 with the caries-free state, but this was not true for S. mutans and the caries-active state.Knowledge Transfer Statement:Patients? and dentists? concerns about transmission of bacteria within families causing caries should be tempered by the evidence that some shared bacteria may contribute to good oral health.},

	abstract = {Dental caries (cavities), one of the most common infectious diseases, is caused by a number of factors. Oral microbes, dietary practices, sociodemographic factors, and dental hygiene all inform caries risk. Assessing the impact of diet is complicated as individuals eat foods in combinations, and the interactions among the foods may alter caries risk. Our study aimed to prospectively assess the association between dietary patterns and caries risk in the postpartum period, a potentially sensitive period for caries development. We analyzed in-person dental assessments and telephone food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) from 879 Caucasian women participating in the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia Cohort 2 (COHRA2) that were collected biannually for up to 6 y. One-week recall of food intake frequency was assessed using a Likert scale. We used principal component analysis to summarize the FFQ data; the top 2 components described 15% and 12% of the variance in FFQ data. The first component was characterized by high consumption of fruits and vegetables, while the second component was heavily influenced by desserts and crackers. We used a modified Poisson model to predict the risk of an increase in the number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth in the postpartum period by 1) dietary patterns and 2) individual foods and beverages at the previous study visit, after controlling for other known risk factors, including history of carious lesions. Eating a dietary pattern high in desserts and crackers was associated with a 20% increase in the number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth in the postpartum period (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.39). However, this effect was attenuated among those who also consumed a dietary pattern high in fruits and vegetables. Dietary patterns should be considered when devising interventions aimed at preventing dental caries.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Urinary catheterization, even of short duration, increases the risk of subsequent urinary tract infection (UTI). Whether the bacteria found on the surface of catheters placed for <3 days are associated with UTI risk is unknown.
METHODS: We screened the biofilms found on the extraluminal surface of 127 catheters placed for <3 days in women undergoing elective gynecologic surgery, using targeted quantitative polymerase chain reaction and an untargeted 16S rRNA taxonomic screen.
RESULTS: Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Enterococcus spp were found on virtually all catheters and lactic acid bacteria in most catheters regardless of duration, but neither genus was associated with UTI development during follow-up. Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus were the most commonly identified genera in the taxonomic screen but were not associated with subsequent UTIs. Although the most common cause of UTI following catheter removal was Escherichia coli, detectable E coli on the catheter surface was not associated with subsequent UTIs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis does not suggest that the presence of bacteria on the surface of catheters placed for <3 days leads to subsequent UTIs. Other aspects of catheter care are likely more important than preventing bacterial colonization of the catheter surface for preventing UTIs following short-term catheter placement.},

@article{Townsend:2020ui,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The U.S. is facing an unprecedented number of opioid-related overdose deaths, and an array of other countries have experienced increases in opioid-related fatalities. In the U.S., naloxone is increasingly distributed to first responders to improve early administration to overdose victims, but its cost-effectiveness has not been studied. Lay distribution, in contrast, has been found to be cost-effective, but rising naloxone prices and increased mortality due to synthetic opioids may reduce cost-effectiveness. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of increased naloxone distribution to (a) people likely to witness or experience overdose ("laypeople"); (b) police and firefighters; (c) emergency medical services (EMS) personnel; and (d) combinations of these groups.
METHODS: We use a decision-analytic model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of eight naloxone distribution strategies. We use a lifetime horizon and conduct both a societal analysis (accounting for productivity and criminal justice system costs) and a health sector analysis. We calculate: the ranking of strategies by net monetary benefit; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios; and number of fatal overdoses.
RESULTS: High distribution to all three groups maximized net monetary benefit and minimized fatal overdoses; it averted 21% of overdose deaths compared to minimum distribution. High distribution to laypeople and one of the other groups comprised the second and third best strategies. The majority of health gains resulted from increased lay distribution. In the societal analysis, every strategy was cost-saving compared to its next-best alternative; cost savings were greatest in the maximum distribution strategy. In the health sector analysis, all undominated strategies were cost-effective. Results were highly robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Increasing naloxone distribution to laypeople and first responder groups would maximize health gains and be cost-effective. If feasible, communities should distribute naloxone to all groups; otherwise, distribution to laypeople and one of the first responder groups should be emphasized.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Dental caries experience, which affects 91% of US adults, is a consequence of a carious process influenced by diet. Although individual foods have been implicated, we hypothesized that dietary patterns might be important predictors of caries presence.
METHODS: We analysed data from 4467 people ≥18 years old participating in the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from 24-hour dietary recalls were classified into standard food categories and reduced to three dietary patterns using principal components (PCs) analysis. We used regression to model the log-transformed decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) score and the prevalence of any caries experience by quartiles of PC scores, controlling for potential confounders. Dietary patterns differed by age with respect to dental caries so 18-30-year-olds (n = 1074) and >30-year-olds (n = 3393) were analysed separately.
RESULTS: Similar dietary patterns existed among individuals aged 18-30 and >30 years, but the prevalence of DMFT score >0 and the median of DMFT was greater in those >30:78.7% (95% CI: 76.1, 81.3) vs 92.6% (95% CI: 91.4, 93.7) and 4 (95% CI: 4, 5) vs 12 DMFT (95% CI: 11, 13), respectively. In those 18-30, no dietary pattern was associated with greater prevalence or severity of dental caries experience. Among those >30, the prevalence of DMFT>0 was higher by 2% for those in each subsequent quartile of a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages and sandwiches (adjusted PR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.001, 1.03)-thus, the prevalence of dental caries experience was 6% higher among those in the uppermost quartile than in the lowest quartile. For every subsequent quartile in the same pattern, there was a 1.98% higher (95% CI: 0.15, 3.85) DMFT score. However, analysis using the two strongest loading food groups from any of the PCs did not identify any predictors of caries experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Dietary patterns were associated with the prevalence of dental caries experience, with differing findings by age. Although effect sizes were small, the population impact may be substantial. While food groups high in sugar were associated with caries prevalence and severity, associations were more apparent in the context of overall diet. Prospective studies are needed to confirm whether particular dietary patterns are causally related to the development of dental caries.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The research on binge eating has overwhelmingly focused on Whites. We aimed to study gender and ethnic differences in the association between body image dissatisfaction and binge eating in a nationally representative sample of Black adults in the USA.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), 2003-2004. Self-identified Caribbean Black (n = 1621) and African American (3570) adults aged 18 and older were enrolled. The independent variable was body dissatisfaction measured with two items. Using the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI), outcome was lifetime binge eating without hierarchy according to the DSM-IV criteria. Covariates included age, socioeconomic factors (i.e., education and marital status), and body mass index. Ethnicity and gender were focal moderators. Logistic regressions were used for data analysis.
RESULTS: Despite comparable prevalence of lifetime binge eating (5 vs 4 %, p > 0.05), African Americans reported higher body image dissatisfaction than Caribbean Blacks (36 vs 29 %, p > 0.05). In the pooled sample, body dissatisfaction was a strong predictor of lifetime binge eating disorders. There was a significant interaction (p = 0.039) between ethnicity and body image dissatisfaction on binge eating, suggesting a stronger association between body image dissatisfaction and lifetime binge eating for Caribbean Blacks (OR = 11.65, 95 % 6.89-19.72) than African Americans (OR = 6.72, 95 % CI 3.97-11.37). Gender did not interact with body image dissatisfaction on binge eating.
CONCLUSION: Ethnic variation in the link between body image dissatisfaction and binge eating may be due to within-race cultural differences in body image between African Americans and Caribbean Blacks. This may include different definitions, norms, and expectations regarding the body size. Findings suggest that ethnicity may bias relevance of body image dissatisfaction as a diagnostic criterion for binge eating disorders among diverse populations of Blacks.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), multiple episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC; vaginal yeast infection) within a 12-month period, adversely affects quality of life, mental health, and sexual activity. Diagnosis is not straightforward, as VVC is defined by the combination of often nonspecific vaginal symptoms and the presence of yeast-which is a common vaginal commensal. Estimating the incidence and prevalence is challenging: most VVC is diagnosed and treated empirically, the availability for purchase of effective therapies over the counter enables self-diagnosis and treatment, and the duration of the relatively benign VVC symptoms is short, introducing errors into any estimates relying on medical records or patient recall.
METHODS: We evaluate current estimates of VVC and RVVC and provide new prevalence estimates using data from a 2011 seven-country (n = 7345) internet panel survey on VVC conducted by Ipsos Health (https://www.ipsos.com/en). We also evaluate information on VVC-associated visits using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.
RESULTS: The estimated probability of VVC by age 50 varied widely by country (from 23% to 49%, mean 39%), as did the estimated probability of RVVC after VVC (from 14% to 28%, mean 23%).
CONCLUSIONS: However estimated, the probability of RVVC was high suggesting RVVC is a common condition.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major cause of neonatal mortality. The vaginal microbiome is associated with PTB, but results vary across racial/ethnic populations. Some evidence suggests gestational age affects this association. We investigated these associations in a novel population, conducting a post hoc analysis assessing if associations differed between women swabbed at different gestational ages.
METHODS: We compared vaginal microbiomes from women with PTB (n = 25) to a random sample of women with term births (n = 100) among participants in the Pregnancy Outcomes, Maternal and Infant Study, conducted in Lima, Peru. Using DADA2, we identified taxa from 16S DNA sequencing and used Dirichlet multinomial mixture models to group into community state types (CSTs).
RESULTS: If gestational age at sampling was not considered, no CST (diverse, Lactobacillus-dominated or Lactobacillus iners-dominated), was associated with PTB. Among women sampled before 12 weeks' gestation, women with Lactobacillus-dominated CSTs were less likely to have a PTB than those with a diverse CST. Among those swabbed between 12 and 16 weeks' gestation, the reverse was true.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports previous literature suggesting that what constitutes a healthy vaginal microbiome varies by race/ethnicity. Longitudinal studies are necessary to disentangle effects of vaginal microbiome differences over gestation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The bacteriome is associated with susceptibility to some eukaryotic viruses, but no study has examined associations between the salivary bacteriome and human herpesviruses (HHVs). We provide new prevalence and incidence estimates for salivary herpesviruses detection and estimate associations with bacteriome diversity in young children.
METHODS: Salivary samples collected at ages ~2, 8, 12, and 24 months from 153 children participating in the Center for Oral Health Research in Appalachia cohort 2 (COHRA2) were screened for HHVs using the Fast-Track Neuro9 multiplex PCR assay, and for the bacteriome using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We used Cox proportional hazard models to test for associations between the salivary bacteriome and hazards of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV6).
RESULTS: CMV, HHV6, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were detected at all visits. Human herpesvirus-7 (HHV7) was first detected at the 8-month visit and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) was only detected at the 12-month visit. Varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus 2, and human herpesvirus-8 were never detected. HHV6 (24-month cumulative incidence: 73.8%) and CMV (24-month cumulative incidence: 32.3%) were detected most frequently. Increasing salivary bacteriome diversity was associated with longer survival to first detection of CMV (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.24 [0.12, 0.49]) and HHV6 (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.24 [0.13, 0.44]).
CONCLUSION: CMV, HHV6, EBV, HHV7, and HSV1 were detected in the saliva during the first 2 years of life. Time to first detection of CMV and HHV6 was associated with salivary bacteriome diversity, suggesting a possible interaction between HHVs and the salivary bacteriome.},

	abstract = {Prior colonization by Klebsiella pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) is associated with subsequent infection, particularly in intensive care unit (ICU) populations. Screening for VRE colonization, but not K. pneumoniae, is routinely performed in some health care systems. Identification of patient factors associated with K. pneumoniae colonization could enable infection prevention.ICU patients were screened for VRE and K. pneumoniae by rectal swab culture over 2 time periods: July--October 2014 (n = 1209) and January--May 2016 (n = 1243). Patient demographics, baseline laboratory data, comorbidities, and outcomes were analyzed. 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was performed on a subset of patients (n = 248) to identify microbiota characteristics associated with VRE and K. pneumoniae colonization.K. pneumoniae colonization (17.3{\%} of patients in the 2014 cohort, 7.3{\%} in 2016) was significantly associated with VRE colonization in multivariable analysis (P = .03 in 2016; P = .08 in 2014). VRE colonization was associated with poor underlying health, whereas K. pneumoniae colonization was associated with advanced age. The most prevalent operational taxonomic units were Escherichia coli/Shigella spp., Klebsiella, and Enterococcus, consistent with high rates of detectable K. pneumoniae and VRE by culture. Microbial community structure in noncolonized patients was significantly different from those with VRE, K. pneumoniae, or both, attributable to differences in the relative abundance of Klebsiella and Enterococcus.K. pneumoniae co-colonizes with VRE and is a predominant taxon in ICU patients, but colonization was not associated with significant comorbidities. Screening for K. pneumoniae and VRE simultaneously could be an efficient approach for novel infection prevention strategies.},
